## Problem

### Largest Mischievous Group

You are the principal of a school that has some mischievous students. The students stand in a row, described by a string of length $N$: the character `m` is a mischievous student and `g` is a good student.

A  **mischievous group**  is a maximal block of one or more consecutive `m` characters. Find the largest mischievous group and print its starting and ending positions (both inclusive), with positions numbered from $0$. If several groups have the maximum length, report the one that appears first.

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $N$ - the length of the string.
- The second line contains a string of length $N$ consisting of the characters m and g.
### Output Format

Print two space-separated integers: the starting and the ending index of the largest mischievous group.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq N \leq 10^5$
- The string contains only m and g, and at least one m.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
5
mgmmm

```

```
2 4

```

### Explanation:

The groups are $[0, 0]$ (length $1$) and $[2, 4]$ (length $3$). The largest is $[2, 4]$.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
8
mmgmmgmg

```

```
0 1

```

### Explanation:

The groups $[0, 1]$ and $[3, 4]$ both have length $2$; the first one is reported.

### Sample 3:
Input
Output

```
4
gggm

```

```
3 3

```

### Explanation:

The only group is the single student at index $3$.

	int n;
	cin>>n;
	string s(n);
    for(int i = 0 ; i < n ; i++){
        cin>>s[i];
    }
    int a = 0 , b = 0;
    int m = 0 , p = 0 ;
    while(b < n){
        if(b == m){
            b++;
        }else{
            a = b + 1;
            p = b-1;
        }
    }
}
