## Problem

### Diwali PC Build

Chef wants to build a PC for Diwali, which is $K$ days away.

The components currently cost $P$ rupees in total, including RAM. The RAM price increases by $D$ rupees each day, while all other prices remain unchanged.

Chef has decided to buy the components on Diwali. Will his budget of $B$ rupees be enough?

### Input Format
- The first line contains an integer $T$, the number of test cases.
- Each test case contains four space-separated integers $P$, $D$, $K$, and $B$ — the current total cost, the daily increase in RAM price, the number of days until Diwali, and Chef's budget, respectively.
### Output Format

For each test case, print `YES` if Chef can afford all the components on Diwali, or `NO` otherwise, on a separate line.

You may print the answer in any combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le P,B \le 10^5$
- $1 \le D \le 500$
- $0 \le K \le 30$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
100 10 2 120
200 20 3 250
150 5 4 180
100 10 0 90
```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO
```

### Explanation:
- Test case 1: After $2$ days, the total cost is $100 + 10 \times 2 = 120$ rupees. Chef's budget exactly covers the cost.
- Test case 2: After $3$ days, the total cost is $200 + 20 \times 3 = 260$ rupees, which exceeds his budget of $250$ rupees.
- Test case 3: After $4$ days, the total cost is $150 + 5 \times 4 = 170$ rupees, which is within his budget of $180$ rupees.
- Test case 4: Diwali is today, so the total cost remains $100$ rupees. His budget of $90$ rupees is insufficient.

int main() {
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int p,d,k,b;
	    cin>>p>>d>>k>>b;
	    if(p + d * k <= b ){
	        cout<<"YES"<<endl;
	    }else{
	        cout<<"NO"<<endl;
